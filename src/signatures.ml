(** {1 Nodes} *)
(** Nodes are the underlying representation used to build a patricia-tree.
    The module type specifies the constructors they must provide, and a common
    interface used for pattern-matching. *)

(** This module explains how a node is stored in memory, with
    functions to create and view nodes.

    @canonical PatriciaTree.NODE *)
module type NODE = sig
  (** We use a uniform type ['map view] to pattern match on maps and sets
      The actual types ['map t] can be a bit different from ['map view]
      to allow for more efficient representations, but {!val:view} should be a
      constant time operation for quick conversions. *)

  (** {2 Types} *)

  type 'key key
  (** The type of keys. *)

  type ('key, 'map) value
  (** The type of value, which depends on the type of the key and the type of the map. *)

  type 'map t
  (** The type of the map, which is parameterized by a type. *)

  (** {2 Constructors: build values} *)

  val empty : 'map t
  (** The empty map *)

  val leaf : 'key key -> ('key, 'map) value -> 'map t
  (** A singleton leaf, similar to {!BASE_MAP.singleton} *)

  val branch :
    prefix:intkey ->
    branching_bit:mask -> tree0:'map t -> tree1:'map t -> 'map t
  (** A branch node.
      {b This shouldn't be called externally unless you know what you're doing!}
      Doing so could easily break the data structure's invariants.

      When called, it assumes that:
      - Neither [tree0] nor [tree1] should be empty.
      - [branching_bit] should have a single bit set
      - [prefix] should be normalized (bits below [branching_bit] set to zero)
      - All elements of [tree0] should have their [to_int] start by
        [prefix] followed by 0 at position [branching_bit]).
      - All elements of [tree1] should have their [to_int] start by
        [prefix] followed by 0 at position [branching_bit]). *)

  (** {2 Destructors: access the value} *)

  (** This makes the map nodes accessible to the pattern matching
      algorithm; this corresponds 1:1 to the {!SimpleNode}
      implementation. This just needs to be copy-and-pasted for every
      node type. *)

    (** Same constraints as {!branch}:
        - [branching_bit] contains only one bit set; the corresponding mask is (branching_bit - 1).
        - [prefix] is normalized: the bits below the [branching_bit] are set to zero
          (i.e. [prefix & (branching_bit - 1) = 0]).
        - All elements of [tree0] should have their [to_int] start by
          [prefix] followed by 0 at position [branching_bit]).

      Equal nodes created separately will have different
      identifiers. On the flip side, nodes with equal identifiers will always be
      physically equal. *)
end

(** Hash-consed nodes also associate a unique number to each node,
    Unlike {!NODE_WITH_ID}, they also check before instanciating the node whether
    a similar node already exists. This results in slightly slower constructors
    (they perform an extra hash-table lookup), but allows for constant time
    equality and comparison.

    See {!hash_consed} for a details on strengths and limits of hash-consing.

  val to_int : 'a t -> int
  (** Returns a unique number for each map, the {{!hash_consed}hash-consed} identifier of the map.
      Unlike {!NODE_WITH_ID.to_int}, hash-consing ensures that maps
      which contain the same keys (compared by {!KEY.to_int}) and values (compared
      by {!HASHED_VALUE.polyeq}) will always be physically equal
      and have the same identifier.

      Maps with the same identifier are also physically equal:
      [to_int m1 = to_int m2] implies [m1 == m2].

      Note that when using physical equality as {!HASHED_VALUE.polyeq}, some
      maps of different types [a t] and [b t] may be given the same identifier.
      See the end of the documentation of {!HASHED_VALUE.polyeq} for details. *)

  val equal : 'a t -> 'a t -> bool
  (** Constant time equality using the {{!hash_consed}hash-consed} nodes identifiers.
      This is equivalent to physical equality.
      Two nodes are equal if their trees contain the same bindings,
      where keys are compared by {!KEY.to_int} and values are compared by
      {!HASHED_VALUE.polyeq}. *)

  val compare : 'a t -> 'a t -> int
  (** Constant time comparison using the {{!hash_consed}hash-consed} node identifiers.
      This order is fully arbitrary, but it is total and can be used to sort nodes.
      It is based on node ids which depend on the order in which the nodes where created
      (older nodes having smaller ids).

      One useful property of this order is that
      child nodes will always have a smaller identifier than their parents. *)

(** Base map signature: a generic ['b map] storing bindings
    of ['a key] to [('a,'b) values].
    All maps and set are a variation of this type,
    sometimes with a simplified interface.
    - {!HETEROGENEOUS_MAP} is just a {!BASE_MAP} with a functor {!HETEROGENEOUS_MAP.WithForeign}
      for building operations that operate on two maps of different base types;
    - {!MAP} specializes the interface for non-generic keys ([key] instead of ['a key]);
    - {!HETEROGENEOUS_SET} specializes {!BASE_MAP} for sets ([('a,'b) value = unit]) and
      removes the value argument from most operations;
    - {!SET} specializes {!HETEROGENEOUS_SET} further by making elements (keys)
      non-generic ([elt] instead of ['a elt]).

  (** {1:functions_on_pairs Functions on pairs of maps} *)
  (** This section regroups functions that act on pairs of maps.

      {b These functions are where Patricia trees offer substantial speedup
      compared to Stdlib's Maps:}
      - We can often avoid exploring physically equal subtrees
        (for equality tests, inclusion tests, union, intersection, difference).
        This yields important performance gains when combining maps that derive
        from a common ancestor or when using {!hash_consed} maps which have a lot
        of elements in common.
      - We can also avoid visiting a subtree when merging with [Empty] (for union,
        intersection and difference).

      To do so safely, we have
      specialized versions of these functions that assume properties
      of the function parameter (reflexive relation, idempotent
      operation, etc.)

      When we cannot enjoy these properties, our functions explicitly
      say so (with a nonreflexive or nonidempotent prefix). The names
      are a bit long, but having these names avoids using an
      ineffective code by default, by forcing to know and choose
      between the fast and slow version.

      In general, the fast versions of these function will be on [O(log n + d)] where
      [n] is the size of the maps being joined and [d] the size of their difference
      (number of keys bound in both maps to non-physically equal values). The slow
      version is [O(n)].

      Many of these are high-order functions, taking as argument a function [f]
      that operates on elements.
      Due to {{: https://ocaml.org/manual/5.2/polymorphism.html#s%3Ahigher-rank-poly}restrictions with higher-order polymorphism},
      we need to wrap the function [f] in a record, which has a single field [f].
      These is what the [polyXXX] types are for.*)

         the immediate values) and we can safely cast values from one type to the
         other if they satisfy this (since they are already physically equal).

         This is the implementation used in {!HashedValue}. Note however that
         using this function can lead to {b identifiers no longer being unique across
         types}. They will still be unique and behave as expected within a certain type,
         but since some values of different types can physically equal, we may have

            - : bool = true
         ]}
         This can cause problems if you wish to use identifiers of different map
         types together:

            module MapOfMaps = MakeMap(struct

              let to_int (Any x) = HMap.to_int x
            end)
         ]}
         Using this can lead to unexpected behaviors:
         in the following [m3] has cardinal 1, the [m1->"foo"] binding has been
         overwritten:
         {[
           # let m3 = MapOfMaps.of_list [ (Any m1, "foo"); (Any m2, "bar") ]

           # MapOfMaps.to_list m3
           - : (any * string) list = [(Any <abstr>, "bar")]

         This issue does not happen with the two previous variants, since they

          other if they satisfy this (since they are already physically equal).

          This is the implementation used in {!HeterogeneousHashedValue}. Note however that
          using this function can lead to {b identifiers no longer being unique across
          types}. See {!HASHED_VALUE.polyeq} for more information on this.}} *)
